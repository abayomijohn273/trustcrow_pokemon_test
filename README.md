# Trustcrow Code Challenge using NextJS

This project was developed using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [Axios](https://axios-http.com/)

This application consumes data needed for the challenge from the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co)

The assessment was conducted by [Trustcrow](https://gotrustcrow.com/)

## Development Setup Guide

This project uses the latest NextJS version. The project (/src) folder contains the following subfolders:

- **app**: This folder holds the routing page files for the application. **page.js** in the root on /app is the landing page, while **pokemonType** hold a page.js that displays the pokemons generated by the Types/Categories.

- **components**: This folder holds reuseable components across the app. Block components such as go back button, empty data message, loadind spinner and the global app layout components(header, footer).

- **module**: This folder is the folder that serves as the parent component that hold different components/building blocks that makes up a page. The files under the folder are exported to the page.js in /app. Purpose of doing this is to make sure files in /app as seen as a routing system and modules the parent component that makes up the page

- **services**:  This folder houses the api request functions. In a larger application, this folder usually contain axios setup, dedicated api urls files, request files.

- **styles**: This folder contains the app global styling and a file main.css that can be used if there is a need for more custom styling. however, it is usually contain little to no code because TailwindCSS can handle anything relating to styling.

- **utils**: This contains reusable function or utilities across the app. like capitalieFirstLetter function, etc.

## APIS

We are using PokeAPI and here is the list of APIs used.

For this assessment, the first goal is to list all pokemon categories/types; **(https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/type)**.
Then, When a user clicks on a category, it should display a list of all the pokemons that belongs to
that specific category; if more than 25 pokemons are to be listed, it sould implement a
pagination mechanism; **(https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/type/1/)**
NOTE: Pokemon data generated from this list does not have pagination. Therefore, Pagination & Search was handle with the total data in the pokemon array.

If a user clicks on a pokemon, it should display the pokemon details and stats; **(https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/move/234/)**

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Hanken Grotesk, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
